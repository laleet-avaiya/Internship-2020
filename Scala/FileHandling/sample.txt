              Scala File handling

Scala provides predefined methods to deal with file.
You can create, open, write and read file.
Scala provides a complete package scala.io for file handling.

Scala Read File
We can use scala.io.Source to read data from a file. For reading a file, we have created a test file with below content.

Scala Write to File
Scala standard library doesnâ€™t contain any classes to write files, so we will use Java IO classes for scala write to file.
